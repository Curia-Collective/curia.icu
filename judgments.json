It does also establish the role of the DAO to remove candidates who present such compliance concerns in running for election to the Security Council.\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO Foundation (who represent the DAO in regulating its elections) has suggested this conflict of interest exists because Mudit works for Polygon Labs. The Foundation has not explicitly stated the case for why Polygon is a direct competitor with Arbitrum, but this point of view does not appear to be disputed by Mudit in his publication of concerns on X. Mudit has stated that he is “not surprised” by this decision but framed his candidacy as a “team up” submission between Polygon and Arbitrum.\n\nTherefore, the key facts in this matter are accepted by the parties. This lends towards a judgment for Arbitrum DAO as there is little precedent in interpreting its processes. But notably: The reading here of the DAO Constitution is worth mentioning so as to guide a more faithful interpretation of its goals going forward.\n\nFirst, I will note that I find it a bit hasty for Arbitrum DAO to issue a forum post on this matter the day before the compliance process was to begin (and was expected to occur over 14 days). It would similarly be helpful for the Foundation to publish its compliance check policy and other processes. Furthermore, the strict interpretation of the Arbitrum DAO Constitution to exclude Mudit solely on account of finding a conflict does not seem to accurately convey the Constitution’s apparent intent to accommodate potential conflicts of interest that can still be managed in service of the Arbitrum DAO. Specifically, the Foundation stated as support for their decision the following: “Section 4 of the Arbitrum Constitution 2, outlines that those with ‘affiliations with direct Arbitrum competitors’ are not eligible to join the Security Council”.\n\nThis would seem too severe and restrictive compared to the full language of the cited text. The pertinent portion in Section 4 of the DAO Constitution qualifies that non-compliant conflicts are those “that would prevent [a candidate] from acting in the best interests of” the DAO. Notably, this portion does not seem to permit that a finding of a conflict alone is sufficient as the reason to exclude and prevent the DAO from entertaining possible ways to align with other ecosystems and even competitors through Security Council appointments. Therefore, if a decision is made to exclude candidates, the Foundation should explain why such conflict would be such that it would “prevent them from acting” as per their outlined duties on the Security Council. This kind of clarification should help alleviate any concerns that exclusions might be too hasty, unfair or overly strict.\n\nIn conclusion, a softer reading is recommended for handling conflicts in the future. As well as more publication on process. Overall, the DAO Constitution appears to have contemplated already that competitors might apply to join the Security Council, but is flexible with its preference against those conflicts that “would prevent” faithful compliance. As such, applications from competitors might be otherwise tolerated if there is countervailing or other evidence that would support the notion that they would still fulfill their discrete duties and would not be prevented from serving their role. The ability of the DAO and Council to remove and govern its own members, as well, indicates that future compliance checks can be invoked if a Council member does not appear able to handle their duties in the best interests of the DAO.","favours":"B","timestamp":1712465421,"signature":"0xe7a044d0dca4f4111b68291a5b30f121d8758fc81a4ba6f06b954981fade9c323d866247b94071cea7d02afaacee29b1a990642f1be95d316aca7ac98af8f6b41b","created_at":"2024-04-07T04:50:44.000Z","updated_at":"2024-04-07T04:50:44.000Z"},{"id":"57c721c9-5f4b-4a7d-b05b-7dffc95ed983","filing_id":"38c1bc97-692a-482e-8fd3-906583e75d54","judge":"0xA9D2BCF3AcB743340CdB1D858E529A23Cef37838","reasoning":"The problem here lies in the interpretation of Arbitrum's Constitution. The Foundation decided to take a literal interpretation whereby being associated with a direct competitor of Arbitrum, would prevent someone from acting in the best interests of the DAO, Governed Chains, and the Foundation. However, we do have to note that this wasn't justified - as in, the Foundation didn't really explain why this would prevent Party A from acting in Arbitrum's best interests. On the other hand, Party A seems to accept the decision taken by Party B, since they didn't seem to attempt to appeal it or at least didn't state anything publicly that would give the impression of this.\n\nFrom the Foundation's perspective, their approach was reasonable. The Security Council is Arbitrum's potential single point of failure which is why there's a certain degree of scrutiny in the compliance process - ensuring Arbitrum alignment is crucial. This is why I will vote in favor of Party B, however, I do have some suggestions that could help clear up the situation for both parties and also prevent this from happening again.\n\n1) The Foundation should publish its decision with more detail, explaining why this conflict of interest would prevent Party A from fulfilling its role as a Security Council Member.\n2) Amend Section 4 of the constitution to be more precise on what would or wouldn't be a conflict of interest that would prevent someone from acting in Arbitrum's best interest.","favours":"B","timestamp":1712475394,"signature":"0x750fee61994793052bf4e85892dd9f37d7aaca139090eb7ff71ce5cbf7d50b9e313f5fa5fd6ed78d9e847ba34b4aa5e0cfe1522da94f5eeefba21c9dcba44f3a1b","created_at":"2024-04-07T07:36:36.000Z","updated_at":"2024-04-07T07:36:36.000Z"},{"id":"545efe83-46b4-440d-aeb6-181debe10858","filing_id":"38c1bc97-692a-482e-8fd3-906583e75d54","judge":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000","reasoning":"The DAO acted within the provisions of their Constitution in excluding Mudit due to his employment with Polygon Labs, a stated direct competitor, highlighting a clear conflict of interest that might prevent him from acting solely in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO.","favours":"B","timestamp":1712834895,"signature":"0x","created_at":"2024-04-11T11:28:15.000Z","updated_at":"2024-04-11T11:28:15.000Z"}]
